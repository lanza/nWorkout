** Inputting lifts is broken -- it assumes the set is failed
* NextActions
** Go through the few commits and see what was removed that I should add comments for
** Core Data related things
*** Batch Size
    fetchRequest.fetchBatchSize = 20
*** Add Sort Descriptors
    let sortDescriptor = NSSortDescriptor(key: #keyPath(JournalEntry.date), ascending: false)
    fetchRequest.sortDescriptors = [sortDescriptor]
* LaterActions
** figure out mapping from old JSON format to new CoreData format
** figure out tests to do this
** figure out how to implement tests in project.yaml
** Cleanup coredata usage
** Merge my data manually -- e.g. combine lifts with incorrect names
** Figure out deletion patterns and relationship consistency for e.g. deleted workouts
*** Deleting a workout -> deletes a lift -> breaks a next/prev chain
* Planned
** CloudKit implementation
* Sometime/Maybe
** Remove Coordinators and implement more things in SwiftUI
** Restore routines
*** Figure out if I should have a separate class for Routines or not
** Restore note button via implmeneting the alert in Swift
** Show notes in workout details
** Readd charts
** Figure out that obnoxious CI bot
** Teach settings TextField to dismiss keyboard
* Maybe?
